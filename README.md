bracket-quiz
==============

This is the August quick coding quiz from the [Fresh Bytecode](http://eepurl.com/C1Ycj) Canberra Java newsletter.

In this small repo, you'll find the Bracket Generator which was used to generate the sample data file, a well as a generated brackets file for you to process and play with.

There's also an interface for you to implement in your solution, and a sample test runner to time how fast it runs.

Read more deatils of the challenge on my [Blog](http://blogs.bytecode.com.au/glen).

Looking forward to your creative solutions!

Glen.
